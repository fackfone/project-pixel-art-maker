# Pixel Art Maker Project

## About
This project was built for the last project into the [Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/ud011). The aim of the project was to be able to have a good understanding of concepts
relating to DOM Manipulation, CRUD contents and Browser Events with the JavaScript programming language.
We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies to build this project.
